### Why social media makes you angry, resentful and hotheaded?

Social media can spark anger, resentment, and hotheadedness due to a mix of psychological, social, and algorithmic factors:

1. **Echo Chambers and Polarization**: Platforms amplify content that aligns with your existing views, creating echo chambers. This reinforces biases and makes opposing perspectives feel like personal attacks, fueling resentment. Studies, like one from MIT in 2018, show that divisive content spreads faster because it triggers strong emotions like outrage.

2. **Comparison and Envy**: Social media showcases curated lives—perfect vacations, flawless bodies, or career wins. This can breed resentment through upward social comparison, where you feel inferior or left behind. Research in *Computers in Human Behavior* (2019) links frequent social media use to increased envy and lower self-esteem.

3. **Outrage Amplification**: Algorithms prioritize engagement, and anger spreads faster than neutral content. Sensational posts or hot takes grab attention, encouraging you to react impulsively. A 2021 study in *Nature* found that negative emotions, especially anger, drive more clicks and shares.

4. **Anonymity and Disinhibition**: Online anonymity reduces accountability, leading to hostile comments or pile-ons. This can make you feel attacked or provoke you to lash out, escalating hotheaded exchanges. The "online disinhibition effect" (Suler, 2004) explains why people act more aggressively online than in person.

5. **Information Overload and Stress**: The constant flood of news, opinions, and notifications overwhelms your brain, raising stress levels. This can shorten your fuse, making you more likely to snap or feel resentful toward others’ posts or perceived slights.

6. **FOMO and Validation-Seeking**: Fear of missing out (FOMO) or chasing likes can make you feel inadequate if your posts don’t get attention. This validation-seeking loop can breed frustration and resentment toward others who seem to "win" at social media.

To counter this, limit screen time, curate your feed to reduce toxic content, and pause before reacting to provocative posts. Reflecting on why a post triggers you can also help manage emotional responses.
