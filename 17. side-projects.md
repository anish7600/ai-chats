### Github Portfolio


### Is it true that having a Github portfolio is just an extra and not an end in itself? 

Yes, that's a fair perspective. A GitHub portfolio is a tool, not the ultimate goal. It showcases your coding skills, projects, and contributions, which can be valuable for job applications, networking, or personal growth. However, it’s not the sole determinant of success in tech. Employers and collaborators often value practical skills, problem-solving, and communication over just a polished GitHub profile. A portfolio is an extra that complements your resume, experience, and ability to demonstrate real-world impact. It’s not an end in itself—think of it as a means to display your work, not the work itself.
