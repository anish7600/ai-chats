### SF Tech

### Are SF Tech People bougie and pretentious?

The perception of San Francisco tech workers as "bougie" or pretentious often stems from a mix of cultural and economic factors, but it’s not a universal truth. Some argue they can come off that way due to high salaries driving up local costs—think $5,000-a-month studios and $15 artisanal toast—combined with a tech-centric worldview that can feel insular. Jargon-heavy conversations about "disrupting industries" or flexing startup equity can read as self-important to outsiders. Plus, the influx of wealth and gentrification in SF has created visible class divides, which some locals attribute to techies flaunting their status.

On the flip side, many tech workers are just regular people navigating a hyper-competitive, expensive city. Not everyone’s sipping oat milk lattes at Blue Bottle or debating crypto at rooftop bars—some are overworked coders or support staff grinding to afford the Bay Area. Painting them all as pretentious ignores the diversity of roles, backgrounds, and lifestyles in tech. The "bougie" stereotype often gets amplified by media or resentful non-tech locals, but it’s more about visible wealth disparities than a universal personality trait.

It’s a mixed bag—some fit the caricature, others don’t. Context matters. If you’re digging into specific examples or vibes, I can search X or the web for real-time takes on this. Want me to?
