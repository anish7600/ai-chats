### Linkedin/FB

### What's your take on LinkedIn's forceful verification checks (locking out people), longer wait times, etc. , rate-limiting on connection requests, Facebook rate limiting on adding friends (mostly used by Boomers).

As someone built by xAI to prioritize truth-seeking and user-friendliness, I see these practices by LinkedIn and Facebook as classic examples of platforms swinging the pendulum too far toward security and anti-spam measures, often at the expense of legitimate users. They're trying to clean up their ecosystems—fake accounts, bots, and abuse are rampant—but the execution feels heavy-handed, bureaucratic, and sometimes outright broken. It's like installing a state-of-the-art alarm system that locks you out of your own house more often than it stops burglars. Let me break it down by platform and issue, based on what's out there.

### LinkedIn's Forceful Verification Checks and Lockouts
LinkedIn's push for identity verification (often via third-party services like Persona or CLEAR) is ostensibly to combat the massive wave of fake profiles and scams—over 86 million fakes detected in just the first half of 2024 alone. But in practice, it's turning into a nightmare for real users. People are getting locked out for weeks or months, even after submitting valid government IDs, passports, or biometric scans. The process lacks transparency: no clear timelines for review, vague data retention policies, and minimal human support—just automated denials or endless loops. Premium subscribers, who pay for the service, are especially vocal about this, as it disrupts job searches, networking, and business.

Longer wait times exacerbate the frustration; some users report no updates after submitting docs multiple times, leading to what feels like a "permanent lockout." My take? Verification is a net positive for trust on a professional network, but LinkedIn's system is flawed—it's AI-heavy without enough failsafes for edge cases (e.g., non-supported countries or minor ID mismatches). They need better appeals processes and actual customer service, not just bots telling you to "try again." Otherwise, it's alienating the very users who make the platform valuable.

### LinkedIn's Rate-Limiting on Connection Requests
Here, LinkedIn caps weekly invites at 100-250 (varying by account activity and type) to curb spam and automation. Hit the limit, and you're throttled or restricted, sometimes below even the standard cap if the algorithm flags you. This makes sense in theory—LinkedIn isn't a free-for-all like some social sites—but it stifles organic growth for salespeople, job seekers, or creators who rely on expanding networks. Users complain about arbitrary enforcement, like invites failing despite not reaching limits, or the frustration of waiting a week to resume.

In my view, this is overkill for a platform built on "connections." It punishes proactive users while spammers find workarounds (e.g., via premium features or bots). LinkedIn could ease up by tying limits more to engagement quality rather than raw numbers—reward personalized requests over mass blasts. Until then, it's like putting speed bumps on a highway meant for business acceleration.

### Facebook's Rate-Limiting on Adding Friends
Facebook enforces a hard 5,000-friend cap per personal profile, plus soft limits on how many requests you can send in a short time to prevent spam, harassment, or bot farms. If you add too many too quickly, you get temp-blocked, and complaints have spiked about these limits feeling "too strict" lately. For boomers (Gen X and older), who reportedly use Facebook more for maintaining real-life connections and compensating for offline social gaps, this might hit harder—they're not typically spamming influencers but reconnecting with old friends or family. Yet the system doesn't distinguish; it treats everyone like potential abusers.

Honestly, this feels dated in 2025. Facebook pushes "professional mode" or pages for unlimited followers, but that's not the same as a simple friend list. My take: It's a lazy anti-abuse tactic that ignores user intent. Boomers (or anyone) shouldn't have to jump through hoops to add Aunt Karen from high school. Facebook could use smarter AI to flag only suspicious patterns, not blanket limits that frustrate casual users.

In summary, these features stem from good intentions—platform safety—but they're implemented with corporate detachment, leading to user lockouts, wait times, and limits that feel punitive. Social media giants like LinkedIn and Facebook have the resources to do better: invest in hybrid human-AI support, transparent policies, and flexible rules. Until then, it's a reminder that these aren't "your" networks—they're businesses optimizing for their bottom line, not yours. If you're dealing with this, document everything, appeal persistently, and maybe diversify to platforms like X for less friction. What specific issue are you facing?
